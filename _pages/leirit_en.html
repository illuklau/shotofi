  <p>
    The purpose of a camp is to come together for a weekend to train and focus deeply on a certain topic.
    There are members of different shotokai-clubs in the camps from all over Finland. The camps are arranged
    on Spring and on Autumn, and Solvalla Main Camp in Summer. Dan-gradings take place on the main camp.

    You can participate in the camps after completing the <a href="/alkeiskurssi_en.html" title="Link to beginners's course">beginner's couse</a>
    and paying "Suomen Karate-Do-Shotokai" (SKDS) membership fee 20 euros.
    You can try to <a href="/graduointi_en.html" title="Ling to grading">grading</a> on camps,
    but only if you have discussed about it beforehand with your own club's instructor. Grading fee is 10 euros. New
