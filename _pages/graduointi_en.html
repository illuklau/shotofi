    <h2>GRADING</h2>
  </header>

  <p>
    Grading takes place on a camp or in own club's grading training. After green belt all gradings take place on camps.
    Grading on a camp always requires the trainee to take part in the entire camp. Taking part merely in the grading session
    is not enough since the trainee will be evalued during the whole camp.

  <p>
    One must discuss with instructors of our own club about grading before enrolling for grading, preferably by sending
    mail to <img class="email" src="/assets/images/emails/email-ohjaajat.png" />. The price of grading is 10 euros.
  </p>

  <p>
    Trainees must also join our umbrella organisation (SKDS) in order to graduate after orange belt.
    Our club's board will give you instructions on how to join (<img class="email" src="/assets/images/emails/email-hallitus.png" />).
    The membership fee has been 30 euros during last years. The SKDS organizes the camps in Finland.
